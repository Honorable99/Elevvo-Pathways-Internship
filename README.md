### 1. Project 1: Superstore Sales Data Analysis.

This isn’t just another dashboard… it’s a story told through numbers.
So, what did we analyze? A Superstore’s sales data, and here’s what we uncovered:

One powerful thing about analysis is that it brings light to areas once in the dark. Think of it as a torch that reveals what was hidden — and that’s exactly what we did here.

Here’s what we discovered:

 • Total revenue recorded was 22,615,37
 • We had a total of 793 customers
 • Sales spanned across 529 cities, 49 states, and involved 1861 products
 • All distributed over 4 major regions

Digging deeper into the insights:

 • The Western region emerged with the highest sales
 • Consumers (as a customer segment) generated the highest sales
 • Our top customer? Sean Miller
 • California led in sales by state, while New York City topped the list by city
 • In terms of monthly performance, April and February recorded the highest sales

What to do with these insights?

 • Prioritize marketing efforts and promotions in high-performing regions like the West
 • Focus on consumer segments when targeting ads, bundles, and loyalty programs
 • Offer tailored experiences or exclusive deals to top customers like Sean Miller
 • Dive deeper into what made April and February peak months — promotions? Seasonality? Demand spikes?
 • Study low-performing states and cities to improve overall market reach

Tool Used: Microsoft Excel

### 2. Project 2: Brazil E-Commerce Data Analysis

This isn’t just another dashboard… it’s a narrative woven from data.

So, what did we dive into? A full-scale analysis of Brazil’s e-commerce landscape, and here’s what came to light:

Analysis is like holding a torch in a dark room — it reveals hidden patterns, exposes key opportunities, and gives life to raw data. And that’s exactly what this project achieved.

Key Insights Discovered:

 • Customer engagement peaked in Xanxerê, identifying it as the most active region for consumer activity.
 • On the supply side, Votorantim stood out, housing the largest number of sellers and serving as a key hub for product distribution.
 • Among all product categories, decorative furniture led the market, outperforming bedding, tableware, and others in both interest and volume.
 • The platform showed exceptional delivery performance — with successful deliveries across the board and minimal cancellation rates, signaling a highly efficient logistics system.
 • A variety of payment options also showed that customers have diverse preferences — an area worth tracking for continuous experience optimization.

What To Do Next:

 • Expand customer targeting beyond Xanxerê to reduce reliance on one major region and tap into emerging markets.
 • Double down on marketing and inventory management for top-performing categories like decorative furniture.
 • Provide additional support, tools, and incentives to sellers in Votorantim to sustain supply strength.
 • Continue maintaining logistics excellence and low cancellation rates to retain customer trust.
 • Monitor and enhance payment experience based on usage data to improve conversions and satisfaction.

### 3. Project 3: Superstore Sales Analysis


This isn’t just another dashboard… it’s a story told through numbers.

We took a deep dive into Superstore’s sales performance, and what we uncovered is a classic case of how data can illuminate patterns, expose gaps, and drive better business decisions.

Because at its core, analysis is a spotlight — revealing what was always there, just hidden in plain sight.

🔍 What We Discovered:

 • Total revenue recorded stood at $2 million
 • The data included 793 unique customers
 • Sales occurred across 529 cities, 49 states, and involved 1849 different products
 • All of this activity was spread across 4 key regions

📈 Deeper Insights Uncovered:

 • The Western region recorded the highest sales overall
 • Among customer segments, Consumers generated the most revenue
 • Our top individual customer? Sean Miller
 • California was the best-performing state, while New York City led among cities
 • April and February stood out with the highest monthly sales trends

 What To Do Next:
 
 • Channel more marketing efforts toward high-performing regions like the West
 • Refine targeting strategies to focus on the high-value Consumer segment
 • Recognize and reward loyal customers like Sean Miller with exclusive offers or loyalty perks
 • Investigate why April and February spiked — was it seasonal, promotional, or something else? Then replicate success factors
 • Analyze low-performing areas to uncover improvement opportunities and expand reach

### 4. Project 4: Data Survey Analysis
The task? Analyze a Data Survey (2017–2021) and tell the story hidden inside the numbers.

It started with the basics:

 • How long have people been writing code?
 • Where are they from?
 • What’s their highest education?
 • Which age group dominates?
 • What’s the gender breakdown?

But as I dug deeper, the picture became richer. I explored:

 • The most popular programming language.
 • The preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
 • The go-to hosted notebook product.
 • The most used data visualization library.

And here’s what the data revealed:

 • 🌍 India emerged as the country with the highest number of users.
 • 🎓 Most hold a Bachelor’s degree.
 • ⌛ Many have been coding for 1–3 years.
 • 👶 The 18–21 age group leads the pack.
 • 👨‍💻 Males outnumber females in the dataset.
 • 🐍 Python reigns as the most-used programming language.
 • 💻 Visual Studio is the top IDE choice.
 • 📒 Kaggle Notebook leads as the most popular hosted notebook product.
 • 📊 Matplotlib is the favorite for data visualization.
